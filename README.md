# FPA -Frustrated Powershell Admin

This is nothing else that a collections of "stuff".
Script, cmdlet, functions and so on that made my admin life slightly less frustrating using powershell.
Obviously this comes out of nowhere, nobody ever heard about this and there no warraties.
Use this at you very own risk. Hope you won't get fired.
